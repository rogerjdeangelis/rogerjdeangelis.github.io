Importing complete! Your new repository

Just wait
This should appear however it might take minutes?

Last but not least, we will set up the Github Pages website.
On the repository main menu, go to settings (pink rectangle on the screenshot below),
select the Pages option (blue rectangle), and select the branch you want to use
and the folder website files are located. In this case, we will select the docs
folder (yellow rectangle). Once you complete those steps, you should get the
link for the Github Pages website (brown rectangle). It might take a
few minutes until the website is ready and accessible.
